# Simple tooling

A collection of simple tools you can use as a developer to boost your productivity

## Prerequisites

- Python so that it is calleable via `python3` in the terminal
- jq: install via `sudo apt install jq` or `brew install jq` for mac users

## Installation

- Clone this repo and `cd` into it
- Run `cp .env.example .env` to copy the .env file
- Enter your OpenAI API key or other LLM provider variables into the .env file. The LLM provider used depends on what env variables you provide.

#### For Mac OS
- Run `chmod +x zshrc/setup.sh`
- Run `./zshrc/setup.sh`

#### For Windows
Add one of the following lines to your shell configuration file:

For Bash users (add to ~/.bashrc): source <SIMPLE_TOOLING_REPO_PATH>/bashrc/index.sh
For Zsh users (add to ~/.zshrc): source <SIMPLE_TOOLING_REPO_PATH>/zshrc/index.sh
where <SIMPLE_TOOLING_REPO_PATH> is the path to this repository


## Usage

### Shell commands

- `doit`: Run `doit` followed by an input prompt to get a shell command that does the specified action. Eg. `doit list all files` should result in your next terminal input being filled with `ls -a`.
- `ask`: Run `ask` followed by an input to get a quick LLM explanation of your query. Eg. `ask what is 1+1` should result in `1+1 equals 2` being echoed to your terminal. 
  - Start the input with ` 1 ` to include the previous response for semi-conversation like behavior. Eg `ask my name is Tim` followed by `ask 1 what is my name` should result in `Your name is Tim.`.
- `push`: Stages, commits and pushes all changes at current path using an LLM generated commit message, following the conventional commit standard. Will ask for approval and can be given feedback to improve commit message. Warning: does not undo staging of files if you interrupt out of it (eg using ctrl+c).
- `diff`: Summarises all unstaged file changes, including new files
- `halleluja`: Plays a Handel Hallelujah sound effect (if using WSL only works with Windows 11)
